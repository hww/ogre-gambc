## Requirements

1. Install required files with

   $ scripts/install-required.sh

2. Set the environment var OGRE_HOME to the root of this project. 

   After building there will be created bin, lib, include, share, info. Look at the example of my .bashrc file

   export OGRE_HOME=/home/valery/projects/ogre-gambc
   export PATH=:$OGRE_HOME/bin:$PATH

3. Make the symbolic link '/planet' to the $OGRE_HOME folder. 

   $ cd /
   $ sudo ln -s <path to project> planet
   $ sudo chown <your user name> planet

4. Add to /etc/ld.so.conf the line /planet/lib

   $ sudo echo "/planet/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
   $ sudo ldconfig

   Look inside scripts/install.sh to see an example.

5. Download in build the next libraries in exact same order.

   OIS 1.3
   Boost 1.42
   Ogre 1.72
   Gambit-C 4.6.0

   The src folder has single folder for each of those libraries. Drop archives inside those folders. Each of that folders has a script build.sh wich will build and install the  library.

   $ cd src/ois
   $ ./build
   ...

6. Build the ogre-gambc application

   $ cd src/ogre-gambc
   $ make
   $ ./game
