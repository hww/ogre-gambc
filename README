## Requirements

First install required files with scripts/install-required.sh

Set the environment var OGRE_HOME to the root of this project.After building there will be created bin, lib, include, share, info. 

Look at the example of my .bashrc file

     export OGRE_HOME=/home/valery/projects/ogre-gambc
     export PATH=:$OGRE_HOME/bin:$PATH

You need also make the symbolic link '/planet' to the $OGRE_HOME folder. Then add to /etc/ld.so.conf the line /planet/lib, and then make `sudo ldconfig`. Look inside scripts/install.sh to see an example.

You need to download in build the next livraries in exact same order.

OIS 1.3
Boost 1.42
Ogre 1.72
Gambit-C 4.6.0

The src folder has single folder for each of those libraries. Drop archives inside those folders. Each of that folders has a script build.sh wich will build and install the  library.
